# badfetch
A new fetch script written in Ruby, designed to be as bad as I could manage while still technically being functional!

## Dependencies

- `figlet`
- `lolcat`
- Some version of Ruby. Idk if any of these methods require a specific version. Find out for yourself ig?

## Usage

Clone or download this repository. `cd` into the new directory and run `ruby badfetch.rb`. You can also make an alias or something if you don't want to `cd` into the directory each time. I'm not the boss of you, follow your heart.
